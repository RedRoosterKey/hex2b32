* hex2b32
Simple terminal program using STDIN/STDOUT to convert hexadecimal to base32 (RFC 3548).

[[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#page-8][Request for Comments: 4648 - Base 32 Encoding]]

* How to build
Go into the Release directory and run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make all && make test
#+END_SRC

This will create a program called hex2b32 and execute test.sh in the scripts directory.
If all the tests pass, you should be good to go.  A good start would be to read the help by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./hex2b32 --help
#+END_SRC
