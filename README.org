* hex2b32
Simple terminal program using STDIN/STDOUT to convert hexadecimal to base32 (RFC 4648).

[[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#page-8][Request for Comments: 4648 - Base 32 Encoding]]

At the time this program was first written, there was no base32 conversion in coreutils.
A few months after the first version of this program was completed, coreutils added a base32 conversion program to their suite.

Full history on the coreutils implementation can be viewed [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1250113]here]

There are still some systems that have an older version of coreutils, but if you have a version of coreutils with the base32 encoder, this program is effectively equivalent to the command below:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xxd --revert -ps | base32 --wrap=0
#+END_SRC

I have recently added a parity script that compares the output of hex2b32 with the coreutils implementation.
This gives me high confidence that this prior implementation works correctly.

* How to build
Go into the Release directory and run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make all && make test
#+END_SRC

This will create a program called hex2b32 and execute test.sh in the scripts directory.
If all the tests pass, you should be good to go.  A good start would be to read the help by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./hex2b32 --help
#+END_SRC
